I known Scheme from SICPï¼Œ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm a self teach programmer from 2016. SICP is my first programming book, i loved it,
enjoy reading it, i learned so much from SICP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, I work in china, I live by building monitor system. Golang is my working language.
After work, I like think with scheme, write with scheme, play with scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I will write things about Scheme and Computation. I will show you Scheme is a
lovely language, if you like think something. It's also a serious language, little core and
on top it with macro, you can implement so many features in other mainstream languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use English to write, beacause I want to share my think with world, not just China where I
live, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
